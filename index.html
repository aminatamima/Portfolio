The connectivity in this type of network is not fluid even some solutions are proposed regarding this issue. We also have seen protocols such as 6LoWPAN. It allows to forward IPv6 packets efficiently over a Low-Power WPAN (Wireless Personal Area Networks) in order to run standard internetworking protocols such as IP on Wireless Sensor Network technologies.</td>

This project has been proposed by a sailing club named CVRL and located in Ariège, France. They would like the public to be more involved during the regattas they organize by providing them a user-friendly web application to follow the evolution of the races in real-time. Therefore, my team work and I had to develop this web application to show the route of the regatta and the position of each boat on a map of the lake. We named this project IoTracking (IoT + GPS tracking).<br><img src="assets/img/iotracking.PNG" alt=""><br>My team was composed of 6 students coming from different options of INSA’s training program.

                                            The device part group had to choose the electronics components, their assembly, their code and, how they communicate with the LoRa network and the specific tests. The network was under my own responsibility. I was supposed to choose and deploy an open source LoRa network server to allow our devices to communicate with our web application server. Then application part group implemented the web server and the user-friendly application with their database.<br><img src="assets/img/architecture.PNG" alt=""><br>
                                            
                                            
                                            To make the appropriate choice regarding the network server, we had to take account of many constraints such as the network range, power consumption, infrastructure deployment, scalability, etc. After studying many solutions, we decided to choose LoRa that is the most appropriate solution. 
                                            Therefore, I had to learn everything about this technology that is new to me. In addition, I had to understand how this open network server works, how I can include the component and understand the source code to deliver the best result possible with quality. This is an overview of lora network server:

                                            Working on this part was a real opportunity to learn many things about IoT communication protocols, constraints we can faced to deploy a functional network.

But to gain more skills, my working pair and I worked together in the 2 parts. So with Eagle, we have created the required library composed of electronical components as resistances, capacities, microcontroller, and so on… We designed the schematic and had to place the components in order to facilitate the routing between them. The result is shown in the following picture:

                                              I am very happy to finish INSA with a professional training at Orange. As an engineer in networking and telecommunications, it’s a real opportunity to work with such a big company in this sector. With all challenges resulting in IoT boom, in addition with the advent of LTM-E technology that will be better than LoRa and Sigfox according to the prediction, I will learn many more things thanks to this professional training between Orange and INSA

After doing the choice of using Lora server, the first difficulty was to understand the entire structure of this server and how do communicate its components. Then I had to install each component and test them. That also means I had to take in hand a code written by someone else in a programming language I didn’t learn before in order to understand the minimum required to make the server work. Finally I had also to understand how the server talk to a device in one side and transmit data of this device to a web application in another side. <br></td>

                                            To solve this problems I have read all the Lora server documentation given by Brocaar, the GitHub user who developed this open source server. I had to be aware of some configuration constraints. I also used to talk to Brocaar about errors I faced by installing the entire server in my computer. Then Iearned about MQTT protocol that allows my server to communicate with Lora device and the web application. I installed mosquitto clients, an MQTT server to test communication before the real tests with device and web application teams.

                                            I feel have learned many thanks to this problem. From now, I know that Lora communication protocol uses a bridge that converts UDP (used of Lora gateways) to MQTT protocol used by Lora server. I also know that it is the best choice regarding constraints we had to realize the project. In addition, handling this problem allowed me to improve my ability to filter information we can find by doing searches,  and interact with a community of open source.
